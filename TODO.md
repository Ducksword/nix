I want a gnome configuration that includes gdm
options.gnome.enable = true;

the configuration should also have an option for extensions
options.gnome.extensions.enable = true;

the configuration should also have an option for extra programs
options.gnome.bloat.enable = false; <-- default true

make a better install script
